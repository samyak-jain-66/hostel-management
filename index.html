            <p>"Hostel Management System" is system developed for alloting hostels to students.For the past few years numbr of students are
            increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels are also increasing for the accomodation of the students studying in this 
            instituition. And hence there is lot of strain on the people who are running hostel and software are not used usually in this
            context. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problem which occured in carrying out 
            manually.</p>
